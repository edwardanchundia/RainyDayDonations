# RainyDayDonations

Rainyday Donations makes donating to local schoolâ€™s simple for people with a generous heart. Using Donors Choose API, we were able to access projects from public schools within your current location that are in desperate need of
funding. That data was then transferred over to a map view for the user can easily choose which school they would like to donate too. After the school is chosen, the user can go read more information or donate right on the web view. 

For the sake of privacy, the transaction was not shown on the demo.

After the user is done with the transaction, the information is saved localy with the help of Core Data. This information can be view on the profile page.
